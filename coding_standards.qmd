## What is `renv`?

- `renv` is an *R* package that helps make *R* projects **reproducible**
- It records:
  - Exact package versions used
  - Where packages came from (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub)
  - The *R* version used
- This allows collaborators, reviewers, and your future self to recreate the same *R* package environment on a different machine or at a later time

## How `renv` manages packages {.compact}

- **Global package cache**:
  - Stores one copy of each package version on your machine under `renv::paths$cache()`
  - Shared across *R* projects for a given user
  - Can be configured to be shared across users on servers
- **Project library** (`renv/library/`):
  - Is project-specific and contains links to packages in the cache
  - Should never be committed to git

This design saves disk space and ensures isolation between projects.



## Using renv

- In the following we assume the `renv` package is installed. If not, run `install.packages("renv")`  

- `renv` offers a wide set of APIs. The following instructions try to use the minimum set of function calls to achieve all tasks

- We first cover two scenarios to start using renv

- We then explain how to use renv for routine package management


## Scenario 1: Using `renv` for the first time {.compact}

- Run `renv::init()`. It
  - Scans project files (`.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`, `.Rnw`) for required packages and their dependencies
  - Creates the folder `renv/library/` and installs packages (or links) into the project library
  - Creates a manifest file `renv.lock`, which contains *R* and *R* package metadata recording the state of the project library (and used to reproduce project library by others or future self)
  - Creates `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`
- Commit `renv.lock` to git
  
*Key idea:* `renv.lock` is the single source of truth


## Scenario 2: Working with an existing R project that contains `renv.lock`

- Run `renv::restore()`. It
  - Installs packages described `renv.lock` into `renv/library` 
  - Creates `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`


## Using renv for routine package management  {.compact}

1. When a project folder has `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`, R loads the project library on startup. This ensures that the right versions of packages are used

2. To install or update new packages from either CRAN (pkg1) or github (user/pkg2), run
    - `renv::install("pkg1"); renv::install("user/pkg2")` or
    - `renv::install(c("pkg1", "user/pkg2"))`

3. To update `renv.lock` with package version info, run `renv::snapshot()`

[ Note:  renv::install can also install specific versions of packages.]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}




## Key `renv` functions
- `renv::init()`
- `renv::restore()`
- `renv::install()`
- `renv::snapshot()`


## Limitation of `renv`

- `renv` records the **R version** but does not install *R* for you
- Collaborators must install a compatible *R* version separately



## Advanced topics

In the following we will cover some more advanced topics related to renv.

## .renvignore
If project includes *R* code that should or can be ignored by `renv`, add respective files/folders to `.renvignore` at the top level
- E.g., add `dev/**` to ignore the folder `dev` and all its content


## renv.lock at different levels of code hierarchy {.compact .smaller}

- The repo CoVPN/correlates_reporting2 contains multiple modules (e.g., cor_coxph, cor_threshold) for multiple types of analyses. We recommend either using module-level project library (e.g., cor_coxph/renv.lock) or project-level libary (e.g. cor_threshold/sanofi_stage2/renv.lock)

- To use module-level project library, some changes are needed so that rendering Rmd reports uses module-level library instead of roor-level libary. Take cor_coxph as an example
  - Edit _build_chapeter.sh (see cor_coxph for example)
  - Copy index_cor.Rmd and book.bib from repo root to cor_coxph/
  - Move _bookdown_cor_coxph.yml from repo root to cor_coxph/
  - Update all files at module level to replace module name by '.', e.g.
    - res = knitr::knit_child(c(here::here('cor_coxph', 'additional_model.Rmd'))) becomes
    - res = knitr::knit_child(c(here::here('.', 'additional_model.Rmd')))
